   - Thinking DNA: Behavior constraint analysis, friction reduction
   - Heuristics: 5 decision rules + veto conditions
   - Smoke Tests: 3/3 (behavior model application, friction analysis, tiny habit design)

### Orchestrator
7. ✅ `market-research-chief.md` - Market Research Chief
   - Role: Research conductor and insight synthesizer
   - Routing Logic: Decision matrix for framework selection
   - Integration Rules: Sequential dependency (Porter → Christensen → Zaltman → McGrath → Eyal → Fogg)
   - Decision Gates: 6 quality checkpoints
   - Parallelization: Within McGrath's testing phase only

## Phase 3: SQUAD CONFIGURATION ✅ COMPLETE

Completed artifacts:
- ✅ `config.yaml` - Full squad configuration (activation commands, workflows, metadata)
- ✅ `README.md` - Complete documentation (workflows, framework guide, quick start)
- ✅ `CREATION_LOG.md` - This log with full status tracking

---

## Quality Gates ✅ PASSED

- ✅ SOURCE_QUALITY: All 6 frameworks backed by documented books, research, cases
- ✅ VOICE_QUALITY: 8+/10 - Signature phrases, anti-patterns, tone defined for each
- ✅ THINKING_QUALITY: 7+/9 - Decision frameworks, heuristics, handoff triggers
- ✅ SYNTHESIS_QUALITY: Consistent integration across all frameworks
- ✅ SMOKE_TEST: 18/18 passing (3 tests × 6 agents = all pass)

## Final Status: RELEASED ✅

**Commit:** `feat: Create Market Research Elite Squad with 6 elite minds`
- Hash: 977d29f
- Date: 2026-02-19
- Status: Active and ready for deployment

**Squad Activation:**
```bash
@market-research-elite:orchestrator    # Full research pipeline
@market-research-elite:{agent-name}    # Individual framework access
```
