## PHASE 0: David Aaker - Brand Vision Model

### What It Is
A strategic framework for defining brand essence, vision elements, and positioning that guides all business decisions.

### Core Concept
**Brands are Assets.** They have strategic value and drive business performance. A clear brand vision (not current image) guides strategy.

### Key Components

**1. Brand Equity (3 dimensions)**
- **Awareness** - Recognition, recall, familiarity
- **Associations** - Attributes, benefits, personality, user imagery
- **Loyalty** - Customer inertia, difficult to switch

**2. Brand Vision Elements (6-12 items)**
- **Core Vision** (2-5 most powerful elements) - Drive programs
- **Extended Vision** (rest) - Add texture, provide flexibility

**3. Brand Essence** (Optional but powerful)
- Single thought capturing core identity
- Example: "Transforming Futures" (London Business School)
- Example: "Family Magic" (Disneyland)

**4. Proof Points**
- Capabilities and programs that deliver the promise
- Visible (customer sees) or behind-scenes (infrastructure)
- If weak → Strategic Imperative needed

### 20 Principles Overview
1-2: Recognize brands as assets
3-9: Have compelling brand vision
10-14: Bring brand to life
15-16: Maintain relevance
17-20: Manage brand portfolio

### Output
- Brand vision document (6-12 elements)
- Brand essence (2-4 words)
- Strategic imperatives (if proof points weak)
- Brand positioning (short-term communication strategy)

### When to Use
- **Always first** - Sets foundation for all other research
- Defining brand strategy for new market entry
- Repositioning existing brand
- Creating brand architecture across products

### Success Criteria
✅ Brand vision is aspirational (not current)
✅ Vision elements differentiate from competitors
✅ Proof points exist or strategic imperatives defined
✅ Team feels inspired by the vision

## PHASE 1: Indy Young - Mental Models

### What It Is
Visual representation of how users actually think about your domain - what tasks they're trying to accomplish, not features they want.

### Core Concept
**Understanding user behavior > understanding user preferences.** Mental models are affinity diagrams of user behaviors, organized by task patterns.

### Key Components

**1. Task-Based Audience Segments** (Not demographics!)
- Define by what they're trying to accomplish
- Example: "People trying to reduce financial anxiety" (not "entrepreneurs 25-35")

**2. Mental Model Diagram**
- Vertical: Tasks users are trying to accomplish
- Horizontal: Sequence or category
- Visual shows structure of how users think

**3. User Research Method**
- Interviews (non-leading, behavior-focused)
- Observation in context
- "Tell me about the last time you..." (specific moments)

**4. Pattern Recognition**
- Group tasks into meaningful clusters
- Different segments ≠ different demographics
- Same segment may think very differently

### 11-Step Process
1. Define task-based segments
2. Write screener (recruiting questions)
3. Recruit participants
4. Set research goals
5. Interview (don't lead!)
6. Analyze transcripts for TASKS
7. Look for patterns
8. Build mental model diagram
9. Validate with domain experts
10. Adjust segments based on findings
11. Use model to guide design/product

### Output
- Mental model diagrams (visual)
- Task flow mappings
- Segment definitions (behavior-based, not demographic)
- Design/product recommendations (derived from model)

### When to Use
- **Phase 1** - After brand strategy, before market analysis
- Understanding how users think about problem
- Identifying real (vs perceived) user needs
- Designing products that match mental models
- Discovering gaps between product and thinking

### Success Criteria
✅ Mental model is visual (not just words)
✅ Tasks extracted from actual behavior (not stated preferences)
✅ Segments are task-based (not demographic)
✅ Design recommendations flow naturally from model
✅ Domain experts validate the diagram

- Buyer switching costs

**4. Threat of Substitutes**
- Are there alternative solutions?
- Different approach to same job
- Cost advantage of substitute
- Customer switching cost

**5. Threat of New Entrants**
- How easy to enter?
- Barrier to entry (capital, knowledge, regulation)
- Economies of scale
- Brand loyalty

### Analysis Process
1. List competitors and rivals
2. Assess each force (strong/medium/weak)
3. Identify critical forces
4. Determine overall attractiveness
5. Identify positioning options

### Output
- Five Forces diagram (visual)
- Industry structure assessment
- Competitive positioning options

## PHASE 3: Clayton Christensen - Jobs to be Done

### What It Is
Framework for understanding what "job" customers are trying to accomplish - deeper than product features.

### Core Concept
**People don't want products. They want to get a job done.** Find the job, find the market opportunity.

### Jobs Dimensions

**1. Functional Job**
- Task to accomplish
- What customer is trying to do
- Example: "Track expenses accurately"

**2. Emotional Job**
- How customer wants to feel
- Perception / emotional benefit
- Example: "Feel confident in financial control"

**3. Social Job**
- How customer wants to be perceived
- Social identity
- Example: "Be seen as professional/competent"

### Analysis Process
1. Identify circumstance (context, trigger)
2. Understand progress desired
3. Define jobs (functional + emotional + social)
4. Map competitive alternatives ("hired")
5. Identify switching triggers

### Output
- Job statements (functional + emotional + social)
- Circumstance descriptions
- Competitive alternatives
- Switching triggers
- Customer segment by job (not demographic)

### When to Use
- **Phase 3** - Understanding customer motivation
- Product design (solving real job, not feature)
- Market segmentation (by job, not demographic)
- Competitive analysis (who else solves this job?)
- Understanding why customers switch

### Success Criteria
✅ Emotional job clearly identified (not just functional)

## PHASE 4: Gerald Zaltman - ZMET Research

### What It Is
Neuromarketing research method using metaphor elicitation to uncover unconscious motivations and emotional drivers.

### Core Concept
**95% of thought happens unconsciously.** Customers can't articulate their real motivations. Use metaphors to access unconscious drivers.

### Key Components

**1. Metaphor Elicitation**
- Ask customer to find images representing brand/problem
- Discuss metaphors (not features)
- Uncover emotional associations

**2. Conscious vs. Unconscious**
- Stated reason ≠ real reason
- Metaphors reveal the real drivers
- Emotions drive behavior, not logic

**3. Research Method**
- In-depth interviews (60-90 min)
- Image-based (customers bring/find images)
- Non-directive questioning
- Metaphor analysis

### Output
- Metaphor analysis (what do images reveal?)
- Emotional drivers (hidden motivations)
- Barriers to adoption (emotional, not rational)
- Positioning insights (emotional positioning)

### When to Use
- **Phase 4** - Understanding emotional drivers
- Discovering barriers to adoption (beyond features)
- Positioning brand emotionally
- Understanding why customers choose you (real reason)
- Uncovering hidden customer fears/desires

### Success Criteria
✅ Metaphors are consistent across participants
✅ Hidden motivations revealed (vs stated reasons)
✅ Emotional barriers identified
✅ Emotional positioning options clear
✅ Insights align with functional job understanding

## PHASE 5: Rita McGrath - Discovery-Driven Planning

### What It Is
Planning framework for environments of uncertainty - validate strategy through assumption testing rather than detailed forecasts.

### Core Concept
**You can't predict the future. But you can test your assumptions, learn quickly, and adapt.** Fail fast on bad assumptions.

### Key Components

**1. Assumption Ranking**
- List all strategy assumptions
- Rank by: impact (if wrong) × uncertainty (likelihood)
- Focus on high-risk assumptions

**2. Test Design**
- Design test to validate/invalidate assumption
- Quick, cheap, learning-focused
- Real-world testing (not surveys)

**3. Learning Triggers**
- What evidence proves assumption wrong?
- What would cause pivot?
- Decision rules before testing

**4. Transient Advantage Strategy**
- Advantages are temporary
- Continuous innovation needed
- Strategy evolves as you learn

### Analysis Process
1. List all strategy assumptions
2. Score by impact × uncertainty
3. Design tests for top 3-5
4. Execute tests in parallel
5. Collect learning
6. Decide: continue, pivot, or stop

### Output
- Ranked assumptions (high-risk first)
- Test designs (what to test, how)
- Learning triggers (when to pivot)
- Roadmap with conditional paths

### When to Use
- **Phase 5** - Validating strategy before investing
- Operating under uncertainty
- Want to fail fast on bad assumptions
- Building learning loops into planning
- Deciding what to test vs what to assume

### Success Criteria
✅ Top 3-5 high-risk assumptions tested
✅ Tests are real-world (not theoretical)
✅ Learning triggers clear
✅ Pivot rules defined
✅ Results inform next phase

## PHASE 6: Nir Eyal - Hook Model (Habit Loops)

### What It Is
Framework for designing habit-forming products - understanding trigger → action → reward → investment cycle.

### Core Concept
**Habits are powerful.** Behavior loops (trigger-action-reward-investment) create retention. Design the loop, not just the feature.

### Key Components

**1. Trigger** (What prompts action?)
- **External:** Cue in environment (notification, social, routine)
- **Internal:** Emotion or thought (boredom, fear, desire)

**2. Action** (What's the simplest behavior?)
- Motivated action with ability to act
- Friction matters (reduce steps)

**3. Reward** (What's the payoff?)
- **Self-reward:** Intrinsic (feeling of progress)
- **Tribe-reward:** Social (connection, recognition)
- **Hunt-reward:** External (points, badges, content)
- Variable rewards are most addictive

**4. Investment** (What commits user?)
- User puts effort in (data, customization)
- Increases switching cost
- Deepens habit

### Analysis Process
1. Map current habit loop (trigger → action → reward → investment)
2. Identify where friction exists
3. Design optimizations
4. Measure habit formation
5. Iterate based on retention

### Output
- Habit loop diagram
- Engagement metrics (DAU/retention)
- Friction points identified
- Optimization roadmap

### When to Use
- **Phase 6** - Designing for user retention
- Building habit-forming products
- Increasing user adoption
- Understanding why users return (or don't)
- Designing for long-term engagement

### Success Criteria
✅ Habit loop complete (all 4 stages)
✅ Trigger is reliable and frequent
✅ Action is easy (low friction)
✅ Reward is meaningful (user wants it)
✅ Investment deepens over time
✅ Retention metrics improve

## PHASE 7: B.J. Fogg - Behavior Model (B=MAP)

### What It Is
Framework for predicting and designing behavior change through optimizing motivation, ability, and prompts.

### Core Concept
**Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt.** All three must exist. Easiest path to behavior change: improve ability (not motivation).

### Key Components

**1. Motivation**
- **Seek pleasure / Avoid pain** (hedonic)
- **Seek hope / Avoid fear** (anticipatory)
- **Seek acceptance / Avoid rejection** (social)

**2. Ability** (Can they do it?)
- Time (reduce required time)
- Effort (reduce steps)
- Money (make cheaper)
- Brain cycles (reduce thinking)
- Physical effort (make easier)
- Social deviance (make less awkward)

**3. Prompt** (What triggers action?)
- Must be at moment of high motivation
- Or anchor to existing routine
- Or use high-emotion moment

### Analysis Process
1. Define desired behavior precisely
2. Assess current M, A, P (all three!)
3. Identify limiting constraint
4. Improve easiest constraint
5. Measure actual behavior (not attitudes)
6. Iterate based on results

### Output
- B=MAP analysis
- Constraint identification (which one limits?)
- Friction reduction strategies
- Execution design (how to reduce friction)

### When to Use
- **Phase 7** - Reducing friction to desired behavior
- Increasing conversion rates
- Designing behavior change programs
- Reducing user abandonment
- Optimizing for execution

### Success Criteria
✅ Behavior is specific and measurable
✅ All three (M, A, P) assessed
✅ Limiting constraint identified
✅ Friction reduction targets main constraint
✅ Actual behavior changes (not attitudes)

## Integration Rules

### Sequential Dependency
```
Aaker → Young → Porter → Christensen → Zaltman → McGrath → Eyal → Fogg

Each output informs next input.
No skipping steps. Order matters.
```

### Decision Gates (Pass/Fail)
1. **After Aaker:** Brand vision clear? YES→Young | NO→Refine
2. **After Young:** Mental models mapped? YES→Porter | NO→More interviews
3. **After Porter:** Market viable? YES→Christensen | NO→Different market
4. **After Christensen:** Jobs clear? YES→Zaltman | NO→Back to Young
5. **After Zaltman:** Emotions align with jobs? YES→McGrath | NO→Reconcile
6. **After McGrath:** Assumptions tested? YES→Eyal | NO→More testing
7. **After Eyal:** Habits designed? YES→Fogg | NO→Refine loops
8. **After Fogg:** Friction reduced? YES→Launch | NO→Re-examine model

### When Integration Breaks
- **Zaltman contradicts Christensen** = Opportunity! Investigate gap
- **Young's mental models differ from jobs** = Refine both
- **McGrath tests fail** = Pivot strategy or test new assumptions
- **Fogg friction remains high** = Problem wasn't B=MAP (check earlier phases)
