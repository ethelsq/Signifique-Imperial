## Cumulative Timeline

### Standard (12 weeks)

```
Week 1-2:   Phase 0 (Brand Vision)               [2 weeks]
Week 1-5:   Phase 1 (Mental Models)              [5 weeks, overlaps Phase 0]
Week 2-4:   Phase 2 (Market Structure)           [3 weeks, overlaps Phase 1]
Week 2-4:   Phase 3 (Customer Demand)            [3 weeks, overlaps Phase 1]
Week 3-5:   Phase 4 (Emotional Drivers)          [3 weeks, overlaps Phase 2-3]
Week 5-10:  Phase 5 (Assumption Testing)         [6 weeks]
Week 6-8:   Phase 6 (Engagement Design)          [3 weeks, overlaps Phase 5]
Week 7-9:   Phase 7 (Behavior Change)            [3 weeks, overlaps Phase 6]

TOTAL: 12 weeks (not 8+5+3+3+3+6+3+3=34)
Because 7 weeks of parallelization saves 22 weeks of sequential time
```

### Accelerated (8 weeks)

**Requires:** 6-person team, higher budget, some acceleration risk

```
Week 1-2:   Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2         [All start together]
Week 2-3:   Phase 3 + Phase 4                   [Parallel]
Week 3-5:   Phase 5 (Testing)                   [Compressed, 3 parallel tests]
Week 5-6:   Phase 6 + Phase 7                   [Parallel]
Week 6-8:   Documentation + Master Report        [Final 2 weeks]

TOTAL: 8 weeks (high parallelization, higher risk)
```

**Risk:** Compressed phases reduce depth. Assumption testing becomes riskier.

### Extended (20 weeks)

**Allows:** Small team, thorough validation, customer co-research

```
Week 1-3:   Phase 0 (Brand Vision) - deep workshops
Week 2-8:   Phase 1 (Mental Models) - 20+ interviews, deep analysis
Week 5-10:  Phase 2 (Market Structure) - comprehensive competitive research
Week 8-13:  Phase 3 (Customer Demand) - 10+ interviews, job validation
Week 11-16: Phase 4 (Emotional Drivers) - 12 ZMET interviews, metaphor mapping
Week 14-20: Phase 5 (Assumption Testing) - 8-week testing with iterative refinement
Week 18-22: Phase 6 + Phase 7 (Engagement + Behavior) - comprehensive design

TOTAL: 20 weeks (deep validation, small team, thorough)
```

*"Success" = All decision gates passed, go/no-go recommendation clear and validated*

---

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Can Run Together to Save Time:**

```
Phase 0 (Brand) → Everything depends on this, starts alone (1 week alone)
  ↓
Phase 1 (Mental Models) → Can't start until Phase 0 complete
  ├─ Phase 2 (Market) ← Can start parallel to Phase 1 (Week 3-4)
  ├─ Phase 3 (Jobs) ← Can start parallel to Phase 1 (Week 3-4)
  └─ Phase 4 (Emotions) ← Can start parallel after Phase 1 starts (Week 4-5)

Phase 5 (Testing) → Depends on Phases 1-4, long phase
  ├─ Phase 6 (Engagement) ← Can run parallel to Phase 5 (Week 6+)
  └─ Phase 7 (Behavior) ← Can run parallel to Phase 6 (Week 7+)
```

**Time Savings from Parallelization:**
- Sequential would be: 2+5+3+3+3+6+3+3 = 28 weeks
- With max parallelization: 12 weeks
- **Savings: 16 weeks (58% reduction)**

**Cost of Parallelization:**
- Requires larger team (+40% cost for parallel resources)
- Higher coordination overhead (+10%)
- But faster time-to-market (-4-6 weeks)

---

## Phase-by-Phase Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path (tasks that can't be delayed):**
1. Phase 0: Brand Vision (1-2 weeks) — **Blocker**
2. Phase 1: Mental Models (3-5 weeks) — **Blocker**
3. Phase 5: Assumption Testing (4-6 weeks) — **Blocker**

**Non-Critical (can be delayed 1-2 weeks without impact):**
- Phase 2, 3, 4 can each slip 1-2 weeks if Phase 1 delayed
- Phase 6, 7 can slip 1 week if Phase 5 delayed

**Minimum Critical Path:** 8 weeks (1+5+2, assuming perfect execution)
**Realistic Minimum:** 10-12 weeks (with decision gate reviews)
