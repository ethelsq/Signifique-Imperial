## Vision Clarity & Strength

### Core Vision Elements

## Proof Points & Strategic Imperatives

### Proof Points Assessment

- [ ] **Proof Points are Visible**

  - For each core vision element, minimum 2 proof points
  - Coverage across product, service, and brand experience
  - No vision element left "unsupported"

### Strategic Imperatives (if gap found)

- [ ] **Imperatives are Clear**
  - For each vision element with weak proof points, imperative defined
