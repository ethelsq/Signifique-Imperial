## Research Rigor

### Interview Methodology

- [ ] **Adequate Sample Size**
  - Minimum 8-12 interviews completed
  - Actual number: [N] interviews
  - Reflects diversity of target audience

- [ ] **Non-leading Interview Approach**
  - Questions focused on past behavior, not preferences
  - "Tell me about the last time you..." format used
  - No "would you like..." type questions
  - Interviewer avoided biasing responses

- [ ] **Interview Context**
  - Interviews conducted in natural context where possible
  - Or clear memory of context established
  - Environmental factors noted if relevant

- [ ] **Interview Quality**
  - Interviews recorded/transcribed where possible
  - Quotes captured directly from interviews
  - Deep probing used (multiple "why" questions)
  - Each interview minimum 45-60 minutes

### Data Collection & Documentation

- [ ] **Interview Artifacts Preserved**
  - [ ] Audio recordings or transcripts
  - [ ] Interview notes with key quotes
  - [ ] Participant backgrounds documented
  - [ ] Interview dates and locations noted

- [ ] **Research Bias Documented**
  - Researcher acknowledged own assumptions
  - Any conflicts of interest noted
  - Alternative interpretations considered
  - Evidence of trying to disprove hypothesis

## Analysis Quality

### Affinity Diagramming Process

- [ ] **Task Extraction Complete**
  - All behavioral statements identified
  - Statements describe what users DO (not want)
  - Tasks are specific, observable actions
  - Not features or preferences

- [ ] **Grouping is Logical**
  - Similar tasks grouped together
  - Groups represent logical categories
  - No task appears in multiple groups (or justified)
  - Grouping revealed through data, not imposed

- [ ] **Pattern Recognition**
  - Patterns visible across multiple participants
  - Not just isolated examples
  - Common mental models identified
  - Minority perspectives noted separately

### Mental Model Diagram

- [ ] **Diagram is Accurate**
  - Represents actual user thinking patterns
  - Based on research, not speculation
  - Tasks arranged logically (vertical/horizontal)
  - Relationships between tasks clear

- [ ] **Diagram is Comprehensive**
  - All major tasks from affinity included
  - Multiple entry points visible
  - Branching and sequencing clear
  - Edge cases handled

- [ ] **Diagram is Actionable**
  - Team can understand user thinking from diagram
  - Clear implications for design/product decisions
  - Not overly complex or simplified
  - Could be explained to others

## Segmentation Validity

### Task-Based Segments

- [ ] **Segments are Task-Based (Not Demographic)**
  - Segments defined by tasks users accomplish
  - NOT by age, income, location, or role
  - Behavioral definitions provided
  - Demographic data noted as secondary

- [ ] **Segments are Distinct**
  - Clear differences in task patterns between segments
  - Not just different levels of same behavior
  - Different mental models per segment
  - Competing priorities are clear

- [ ] **Segments are Representative**
  - Each segment has minimum 2-3 interview examples
  - Segment size estimated (% of population)
  - Not just "the outliers"
  - Largest segments focused on first

### Segment Implications

- [ ] **Strategic Implications Clear**
  - Each segment would need different approach
  - Product features weighted differently per segment
  - Messaging would differ by segment
  - Go-to-market strategy affected

## Validation Against Previous Research

### Alignment with Phase 0 (Brand Vision)

- [ ] **User Mental Models Align with Brand Vision**
  - Mental models support brand positioning
  - OR key tensions identified for discussion
  - Not contradictory to brand promise
  - If conflict: explicitly noted for resolution

- [ ] **Brand Can Serve Mental Models**
  - Brand positioned to address user needs
  - Brand proof points relevant to mental models
  - If gap: strategic imperative emerges

### New Insights from Mental Models

- [ ] **Research Revealed Something New**
  - Not just confirming what was assumed
  - Surprised team at least once
  - Challenged at least one hypothesis
  - Uncovered hidden user perspective

---

## User Behavior Patterns

### Task Patterns

- [ ] **Primary Tasks Identified**
  - Core activities users actually perform
  - Not "nice to have" activities
  - Frequency of tasks estimated
  - Critical path tasks noted

- [ ] **Task Sequence Clear**
  - Order in which tasks typically occur
  - Decision points visible
  - Loops and iterations noted
  - Time between tasks estimated

### Barriers & Friction

- [ ] **Barriers Documented**
  - Where users get stuck
  - Why they get stuck
  - How they work around barriers
  - Impact of barriers on behavior

- [ ] **Success Factors Identified**
  - What makes tasks easier
  - Who/what helps users succeed
  - Environmental factors that help/hinder
  - Skills or knowledge required

---

## Documentation Quality

### Research Summary

- [ ] **Report is Clear and Structured**
  - Overview of research methodology
  - Clear presentation of findings
  - Professional formatting
  - Easy to navigate

- [ ] **Evidence is Provided**
  - Direct quotes from interviews
  - Specific examples from observations
  - Data supporting key claims
  - Citations to interview sources

- [ ] **Interpretations are Justified**
  - Why conclusions were drawn
  - What evidence supports conclusions
  - Alternative interpretations considered
  - Confidence level indicated

### Visual Representation

- [ ] **Mental Model Diagram(s) Included**
  - Clear visual representation of tasks/flows
  - Legible and professional
  - Legend/explanation provided
  - Could be shared with stakeholders

- [ ] **Segment Examples Provided**
  - Example user journey per segment
  - Name or persona per segment (optional but helpful)
  - Key differentiators visible
  - Business implications clear

---

## Team Validation

### Research Credibility

- [ ] **Researchers are Trained**
  - Conducted interviews professionally
  - Could explain methodology
  - Could defend findings

- [ ] **Findings Feel True**
  - Team recognizes patterns from customer interactions
  - Mental models match customer support data
  - Sales team agrees these are real behaviors
  - Not a surprise (but should refine understanding)

- [ ] **Team Can Use Findings**
  - Team understands mental models
  - Team could explain to others
  - Team can apply to decisions
  - Questions answered
