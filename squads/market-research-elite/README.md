# Market Research Elite Squad

**A Symphony of 6 Frameworks for Deep Market Understanding**

---

## Overview

The **Market Research Elite** squad combines 6 complementary frameworks from world-class researchers into a sequential research pipeline. Each framework reveals different truths about markets:

- **Michael Porter** → Market structure & competitive dynamics
- **Clayton Christensen** → Customer demand & jobs to be done
- **Gerald Zaltman** → Hidden emotions & unconscious drivers
- **Rita McGrath** → Assumption validation & discovery planning
- **Nir Eyal** → User engagement & habit formation
- **B.J. Fogg** → Behavior change & execution design

---

## Quick Start

### For Market Entry Analysis
```bash
@market-research-elite:orchestrator

Provide market context, and I'll run all 6 frameworks in sequence:
Week 1: Is the market structurally viable? (Porter)
Week 2: What jobs do customers need? (Christensen)
Week 3: What emotions drive decisions? (Zaltman)
Week 4-8: Which assumptions matter most? (McGrath)
Week 9: How do we form habits? (Eyal)
Week 10: How do we reduce friction? (Fogg)
```

### For Specific Framework Usage
```bash
@market-research-elite:michael-porter
@market-research-elite:clayton-christensen
@market-research-elite:gerald-zaltman
@market-research-elite:rita-mcgrath
@market-research-elite:nir-eyal
@market-research-elite:bj-fogg
```

## The 6 Frameworks (Sequential Pipeline)

### 1. **Michael Porter: Five Forces Analysis** (Week 1)
*"What does market structure tell us?"*

Framework: **Five Forces** (rivalry, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, entry barriers)

Use when:
- Evaluating market attractiveness
- Assessing competitive intensity
- Identifying power dynamics
- Deciding market entry viability

Output: Industry structure assessment, competitive positioning options

---

### 2. **Clayton Christensen: Jobs to be Done** (Week 2)
*"What job do customers really need done?"*

Framework: **Jobs to be Done** (functional + emotional + social jobs)

Use when:
- Understanding customer motivation (not demographics)
- Identifying market segments by circumstance
- Finding what customers are "hiring" competitors for
- Designing products for real needs

Output: Job statements, functional/emotional/social breakdown, competitive threats

---

### 3. **Gerald Zaltman: ZMET Research** (Week 3)
*"What emotions and unconscious drivers exist?"*

Framework: **Metaphor Elicitation Technique** + neuromarketing insights

Use when:
- Understanding conscious vs. unconscious motivations
- Uncovering emotional barriers to adoption
- Discovering hidden customer fears/desires
- Going deeper than surveys can reach

Output: Metaphor analysis, emotional insights, hidden motivations

---

### 4. **Rita McGrath: Discovery-Driven Planning** (Weeks 4-8)
*"Which assumptions are riskiest and how do we test them?"*

Framework: **Discovery-Driven Planning** (assumption ranking + testing)

Use when:
- Operating under uncertainty
- Need to validate strategy before investing
- Want to fail fast on bad assumptions
- Building learning loops into planning

Output: Ranked assumptions, test designs, learning triggers, pivot rules

---

### 5. **Nir Eyal: Habit Loops** (Week 9)
*"How do we get users to engage and return?"*

Framework: **Hook Model** (trigger → action → reward → investment)

Use when:
- Increasing user adoption and retention
- Building habit-forming products
- Understanding why users leave
- Designing for long-term engagement

Output: Habit loops, engagement metrics, retention drivers

---

### 6. **B.J. Fogg: Behavior Model** (Week 10)
*"How do we reduce friction to desired behavior?"*

Framework: **B=MAP** (Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt)

Use when:
- Increasing conversion rates
- Designing behavior change programs
- Reducing user friction
- Optimizing for execution

Output: B=MAP analysis, friction reduction strategies, execution design

## Research Workflows

### Complete Market Entry Analysis (10 weeks)
```
START: "We want to enter the coffee market"
  ↓
WEEK 1: @michael-porter
  Q: "Is this market structurally attractive?"
  A: "High rivalry, strong suppliers, switching buyers = UNATTRACTIVE structurally"
  ↓
WEEK 2: @clayton-christensen
  Q: "What jobs are customers trying to solve?"
  A: "Functional: caffeine/energy. Emotional: ritual/comfort. Social: status/belonging"
  ↓
WEEK 3: @gerald-zaltman
  Q: "What unconscious emotions drive coffee purchases?"
  A: "Metaphors reveal: coffee as 'sanctuary', 'rebellion', 'connection'"
  ↓
WEEKS 4-8: @rita-mcgrath
  Q: "What assumptions must we test?"
  A: "High-risk assumptions: price tolerance, quality differentiation, supply chain viability"
  Tests run in parallel
  ↓
WEEK 9: @nir-eyal
  Q: "How do we build loyal customers?"
  A: "Habit loops: morning ritual + social sharing = daily returning users"
  ↓
WEEK 10: @bj-fogg
  Q: "How do we reduce friction to first purchase?"
  A: "B=MAP: high motivation (need caffeine) + low ability (too many choices) + weak prompt"
  Solution: Simplified menu, mobile order, subscription anchor
  ↓
DECISION: Enter coffee market with niche positioning (emotion + convenience, not price)
```

### Competitive Analysis (2 weeks)
```
@michael-porter → Structural analysis
@clayton-christensen → Competitive differentiation via jobs
↓
Output: Positioning options given market structure and job dynamics
```

### Deep Customer Insight Discovery (3 weeks)
```
@clayton-christensen → What customers need
@gerald-zaltman → Why they feel that way (unconscious)
@rita-mcgrath → Validate with testing
↓
Output: Rich customer mental models, emotional drivers, validated insights
```

### Adoption & Behavior Design (2 weeks)
```
@nir-eyal → Engagement mechanics
@bj-fogg → Behavior change execution
↓
Output: Habit-forming product design, friction reduction, conversion optimization
```

## Integration Rules

**Sequential Dependency:**
```
Porter → Christensen → Zaltman → McGrath → Eyal → Fogg
Each agent's output informs the next agent's input
No skipping steps
```

**Decision Gates (Must Pass to Continue):**
1. After Porter: "Is market structurally viable?" → YES/NO
2. After Christensen: "Do we have clear job clarity?" → YES/NO
3. After Zaltman: "Do emotions align with jobs?" → YES/NO
4. After McGrath: "Have riskiest assumptions been tested?" → YES/NO
5. After Eyal: "Are habit loops designed?" → YES/NO
6. After Fogg: "Can we reduce friction?" → YES/NO

If any gate fails → Loop back, don't proceed forward.

## Typical Project Timeline

| Duration | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|

| 8-10 weeks | Full market entry analysis | Enter new market with confidence |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Sequential, not parallel** (except within McGrath's testing phase)
2. **Each framework reveals different truth** - no single framework tells whole story
3. **Integration is the goal** - synthesize findings across all frameworks
4. **Test assumptions first** - don't plan without validation
5. **Behavior matters more than attitude** - focus on what users DO, not what they SAY

---

## Output Example

**Market: Small business accounting SaaS**

```
PORTER (Structure): High rivalry, strong buyer power → UNATTRACTIVE market
CHRISTENSEN (Jobs): Reduce anxiety + gain control without expensive accountant
ZALTMAN (Emotion): Metaphor = "trusted advisor" (not just tool)
MCGRATH (Testing): High-risk assumption = switching from existing tool
  Test Plan: Pilot with 5 SMBs, measure trust rebuild time
EYAL (Engagement): Weekly ritual (financial check-in) → habit loop
FOGG (Behavior): B=MAP = low ability + weak prompt → solution = mobile app + weekly email

INTEGRATED STRATEGY:
- Market is structurally challenging, but emotional positioning (trust) can differentiate
- Focus on reducing switching anxiety (not just features)
- Build weekly check-in habit to increase engagement
- Simplify first-use experience to reduce friction

RECOMMENDATION: Enter SMB market with trust-first positioning, habit-based engagement
```
