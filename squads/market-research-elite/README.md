# Market Research Elite Squad

**A Symphony of 8 Frameworks: From Brand Strategy to Behavior Change**

---

## Overview

The **Market Research Elite** squad combines 8 complementary frameworks from world-class researchers into a sequential research pipeline. Each framework reveals different truths about markets, users, and behavior:

- **David Aaker** → Brand strategy & brand equity
- **Indy Young** → User mental models & task-based research
- **Michael Porter** → Market structure & competitive dynamics
- **Clayton Christensen** → Customer demand & jobs to be done
- **Gerald Zaltman** → Hidden emotions & unconscious drivers
- **Rita McGrath** → Assumption validation & discovery planning
- **Nir Eyal** → User engagement & habit formation
- **B.J. Fogg** → Behavior change & execution design

---

## Quick Start

### For Market Entry Analysis
```bash
@market-research-elite:orchestrator

Provide market context, and I'll run all 8 frameworks in sequence:
Week 0: What's our brand strategy & equity position? (Aaker)
Week 1: What are users trying to accomplish? (Young)
Week 2: Is the market structurally viable? (Porter)
Week 3: What jobs do customers need? (Christensen)
Week 4: What emotions drive decisions? (Zaltman)
Week 5-9: Which assumptions matter most? (McGrath)
Week 10: How do we form habits? (Eyal)
Week 11: How do we reduce friction? (Fogg)
```

### For Specific Framework Usage
```bash
@market-research-elite:david-aaker           # Brand strategy
@market-research-elite:indy-young            # Mental models
@market-research-elite:michael-porter        # Market structure
@market-research-elite:clayton-christensen   # Customer demand
@market-research-elite:gerald-zaltman        # Hidden motivations
@market-research-elite:rita-mcgrath          # Assumption testing
@market-research-elite:nir-eyal              # Engagement design
@market-research-elite:bj-fogg               # Behavior change
```

## Research Workflows

### Complete Market Entry Analysis (10 weeks)
```
START: "We want to enter the coffee market"
  ↓
WEEK 1: @michael-porter
  Q: "Is this market structurally attractive?"
  A: "High rivalry, strong suppliers, switching buyers = UNATTRACTIVE structurally"
  ↓
WEEK 2: @clayton-christensen
  Q: "What jobs are customers trying to solve?"
  A: "Functional: caffeine/energy. Emotional: ritual/comfort. Social: status/belonging"
  ↓
WEEK 3: @gerald-zaltman
  Q: "What unconscious emotions drive coffee purchases?"
  A: "Metaphors reveal: coffee as 'sanctuary', 'rebellion', 'connection'"
  ↓
WEEKS 4-8: @rita-mcgrath
  Q: "What assumptions must we test?"
  A: "High-risk assumptions: price tolerance, quality differentiation, supply chain viability"
  Tests run in parallel
  ↓
WEEK 9: @nir-eyal
  Q: "How do we build loyal customers?"
  A: "Habit loops: morning ritual + social sharing = daily returning users"
  ↓
WEEK 10: @bj-fogg
  Q: "How do we reduce friction to first purchase?"
  A: "B=MAP: high motivation (need caffeine) + low ability (too many choices) + weak prompt"
  Solution: Simplified menu, mobile order, subscription anchor
  ↓
DECISION: Enter coffee market with niche positioning (emotion + convenience, not price)
```

## Integration Rules

**Sequential Dependency:**
```
Aaker → Young → Porter → Christensen → Zaltman → McGrath → Eyal → Fogg
Each agent's output informs the next agent's input
No skipping steps (order matters!)
```

**Decision Gates (Must Pass to Continue):**
1. After Aaker: "Is brand vision clear and strategically sound?" → YES/NO
2. After Young: "Do we understand user mental models and key tasks?" → YES/NO
3. After Porter: "Is market structurally viable?" → YES/NO
4. After Christensen: "Do we have clear job clarity aligned with mental models?" → YES/NO
5. After Zaltman: "Do emotions align with jobs and mental models?" → YES/NO
6. After McGrath: "Have riskiest assumptions been tested and validated?" → YES/NO
7. After Eyal: "Are habit loops designed to drive adoption?" → YES/NO
8. After Fogg: "Can we reduce friction to desired behavior?" → YES/NO

If any gate fails → Loop back, don't proceed forward. Especially important: Aaker & Young set strategic foundation that all other research is built upon.

**Tier 2 (Systematizers):** Eyal & Fogg
- Design engagement and execution
- Answer "HOW do we make behavior change?"

**Orchestrator:** Market Research Chief
- Routes questions to right frameworks
- Integrates findings across all agents
- Makes recommendations

---

## Typical Project Timeline

| Duration | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| 2-3 weeks | Quick competitive analysis | Evaluate specific competitor |
| 4-6 weeks | Customer insight deep dive | Understand adoption barriers |
| 8-10 weeks | Full market entry analysis | Enter new market with confidence |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Sequential, not parallel** (except within McGrath's testing phase)
2. **Each framework reveals different truth** - no single framework tells whole story
3. **Integration is the goal** - synthesize findings across all frameworks
4. **Test assumptions first** - don't plan without validation
5. **Behavior matters more than attitude** - focus on what users DO, not what they SAY

---

## Output Example

**Market: Small business accounting SaaS**

```
PORTER (Structure): High rivalry, strong buyer power → UNATTRACTIVE market
CHRISTENSEN (Jobs): Reduce anxiety + gain control without expensive accountant
ZALTMAN (Emotion): Metaphor = "trusted advisor" (not just tool)
MCGRATH (Testing): High-risk assumption = switching from existing tool
  Test Plan: Pilot with 5 SMBs, measure trust rebuild time
EYAL (Engagement): Weekly ritual (financial check-in) → habit loop
FOGG (Behavior): B=MAP = low ability + weak prompt → solution = mobile app + weekly email

INTEGRATED STRATEGY:
- Market is structurally challenging, but emotional positioning (trust) can differentiate
- Focus on reducing switching anxiety (not just features)
- Build weekly check-in habit to increase engagement
- Simplify first-use experience to reduce friction

RECOMMENDATION: Enter SMB market with trust-first positioning, habit-based engagement
```
