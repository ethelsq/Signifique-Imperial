# Phase 5: Assumption Testing & Validation

**Agent:** @rita-mcgrath
**Duration:** 5 weeks (ongoing testing)
**Deliverable:** assumption-testing-plan.md

---

## Purpose

Test your riskiest assumptions BEFORE investing heavily. Fail fast on bad assumptions. Discovery-driven planning validates strategy.

---

## What You'll Do

1. **List ALL assumptions** - Brand, market, customer, business model
2. **Rank by risk** - Impact if wrong × likelihood of being wrong
3. **Design tests** - Quick, cheap, real-world tests
4. **Execute in parallel** - Multiple tests simultaneously
5. **Collect learning** - What do results tell us?
6. **Decide** - Continue, pivot, or stop?

---

## Inputs Required

**From Phases 0-4:**
- [ ] Brand strategy
- [ ] Mental models
- [ ] Market structure
- [ ] Customer jobs
- [ ] Emotional drivers

**From You:**
- [ ] Budget for testing
- [ ] Access to customers/data
- [ ] Timeline flexibility

## Elicitation: Strategy Assumptions

**[ELICIT]** List your top 10 assumptions:

```
Our strategy assumes:
1. [Assumption - something we believe is true]
2. [Assumption]
3. [Assumption]
...
10. [Assumption]

For each: What if it's WRONG? What happens?
[____________]
```

---

## Assumption Ranking

### Risk Matrix

**Score each assumption:**
- **Impact if wrong:** 1-10 (1=minimal, 10=fatal)
- **Uncertainty:** 1-10 (1=very sure, 10=very uncertain)
- **Risk = Impact × Uncertainty**

**Rank from highest risk downward**

### Top Risky Assumptions (Usually)

1. **Market will pay what we need to charge**
2. **Customer actually has this job/pain**
3. **Our solution is better than alternatives**
4. **Customers will switch from current solution**
5. **We can acquire customers cost-effectively**

## Test Design

### Quick, Cheap, Learning-Focused Tests

**Type 1: Customer Interviews**
- Cost: $0-1K
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Learn: "Do they really have this problem?"

**Type 2: Small Prototype**
- Cost: $1-5K
- Time: 2-4 weeks
- Learn: "Does solution work?"

**Type 3: Fake Landing Page**
- Cost: $0-2K
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Learn: "Would they buy?"

**Type 4: Paid Ad Test**
- Cost: $2-10K
- Time: 1-4 weeks
- Learn: "Will anyone click?"

**Type 5: MVP/Beta**
- Cost: $10-50K
- Time: 4-12 weeks
- Learn: "Will customers use it?"

### Real-World Tests (Not Surveys)

❌ "Would you buy X?" (survey)
✅ "Here's actual X, will you pay?" (real test)

## Deliverable: assumption-testing-plan.md

**Include sections:**

1. **Ranked Assumptions** (Top 5-8)
   - Assumption
   - Impact if wrong: [1-10]
   - Uncertainty: [1-10]
   - Risk score: [multiplication]

2. **Test Designs** (For each top assumption)
   - Assumption
   - Test method: [Interview/Prototype/Ad/MVP/etc]
   - Cost estimate
   - Timeline
   - Success criteria: "What result would prove/disprove?"
   - Learning trigger: "When do we pivot?"

3. **Testing Timeline**
   - Week 1-2: Tests A + B (in parallel)
   - Week 3-4: Tests C + D (based on learning)
   - Week 5: Decision point

4. **Learning Framework**
   - If test A passes: What does it mean?
   - If test A fails: What's next?
   - Pivot triggers: What would cause full pivot?

5. **Decision Rules**
   - "If 3+ tests fail: Stop and pivot market"
   - "If switching cost too high: Different positioning"
   - "If no PMF signal: Refine MVP and re-test"

6. **Decision Gate**
   - Question: "Have riskiest assumptions been tested and validated?"
   - Answer: YES → Proceed to Phase 6 | NO → More testing

## Testing in Practice

**Example: SaaS for accountants**

Assumption 1: "Accountants will switch from existing tool"
- Test: 5-user pilot
- Success if: 3+ would pay $50/month
- Cost: $2K

Assumption 2: "We can acquire customers for $30/month"
- Test: Google Ads + landing page
- Success if: CPC < $5
- Cost: $5K

Assumption 3: "Market size is $100M+"
- Test: Interview 20 buyers + market data
- Success if: $20M+ identified
- Cost: $1K

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Top 5-8 risky assumptions identified
- [ ] Tests designed (not theoretical)
- [ ] Success criteria clear ("proof points")
- [ ] Real-world tests (not surveys)
- [ ] Parallel execution (multiple simultaneous tests)
- [ ] Learning triggers defined
- [ ] Decision rules clear

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If tests reveal fundamental problems:**

- "Market doesn't have this pain"
- "Switching cost too high"
- "Positioning doesn't resonate"
- "CAC uneconomical"

**What to do:**
1. Identify which assumption failed
2. Decide: Pivot positioning or pivot market?
3. Re-test with new hypothesis
4. Continue learning cycles

## Next Phase: Phase 6 - Engagement Design

**Input:** Validated assumptions
**Agent:** @nir-eyal
**Duration:** 1 week
**Purpose:** Design habit loops
