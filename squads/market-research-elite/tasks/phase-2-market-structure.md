## Success Criteria

- [ ] All five forces analyzed
- [ ] Scores justified with data
- [ ] Critical forces identified (not all equal)
- [ ] Clear YES/NO on market viability
- [ ] Positioning options aligned with structure
- [ ] Team understands power dynamics

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If decision gate is NO:**

- Market is fundamentally unattractive (high rivalry + high supplier power + high buyer power)
- Entry barriers too high for your resources
- Profitability structurally impossible in this market
- You're positioning as differentiator but market is commodity

**What to do:**
1. Pivot to different market segment
2. Revisit positioning (can you compete on cost instead?)
3. Wait for market maturity (if new market, barriers might drop)
4. Accept this market is not for you
