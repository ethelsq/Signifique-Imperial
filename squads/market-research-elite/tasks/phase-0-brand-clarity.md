**Include sections:**

1. **Brand Vision Elements** (6-12 items)
   - Functional benefit: What do you deliver?

   - Self-expressive benefit: Identity/status
   - Social benefit: How will they be seen?

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Brand vision is **aspirational** (not current state)
- [ ] Proof points exist OR strategic imperatives defined
- [ ] Team alignment on direction (80%+ agreement)
- [ ] Vision can guide decisions (not vague)
- [ ] Positioning is defensible (why THIS, not competitors)

---

## Output Checklist

- [ ] brand-strategy.md created
- [ ] All 6 sections completed
- [ ] Decision gate answered clearly
- [ ] Next phase input prepared (brand vision document)

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If decision gate is NO:**

- Brand vision is too vague ("Be the best" / "Innovative")
- Proof points don't exist AND strategic imperatives too costly
- Team has fundamental disagreement on positioning
- Vision isn't actually differentiated from competitors

**What to do:**
1. Go back to team interviews
2. Deep dive on: "What's REALLY different about us?"
3. Refine vision elements
4. Re-assess proof points
5. Run decision gate again
