# Phase 6: Engagement & Habit Design

**Agent:** @nir-eyal
**Duration:** 1 week (8 hours)
**Deliverable:** engagement-strategy.md

## Purpose

Design the habit loops that make users RETURN. Engagement is the bridge between discovery and behavior change. Users must form habits to stick around.

---

## What You'll Do

1. **Map current behavior loops** - Where do users interact?
2. **Design Hook Model** - Trigger → Action → Reward → Investment
3. **Identify friction points** - What stops engagement?
4. **Optimize for retention** - Not just acquisition
5. **Define engagement metrics** - How to measure success?

---

## Inputs Required

**From Phase 5:**
- [ ] Validated assumptions
- [ ] Market entry decision (GO)

**From You:**
- [ ] Current product/service
- [ ] User interaction data (if exists)
- [ ] Retention goals

---

## Hook Model Framework

### 1. TRIGGER (What prompts action?)

**External Triggers:**
- Notification (push, email, SMS)
- Social cue (friend using, community)
- Routine anchor (time-based)
- Environmental cue (location, context)

**Internal Triggers:**
- Emotion (boredom, curiosity, fear, desire)
- Thought pattern
- Habit (automatic response)

### 2. ACTION (What's the simplest behavior?)

**Behavior = Motivation × Ability**
- Make action EASY (reduce steps)
- Assume low motivation (make it effortless)
- Examples: 1-click, open app, send message

### 3. REWARD (What's the payoff?)

**Self-Reward:**
- Progress feeling
- Accomplishment
- Competence

**Tribe-Reward:**
- Social recognition
- Connection
- Belonging

**Hunt-Reward:**
- Variability (surprise)
- Discovery
- Mystery

**Variable rewards are most addictive**

### 4. INVESTMENT (What commits user?)

**User puts effort in:**
- Data entry (profile)
- Customization (preferences)
- Content creation
- Social commitment

**Creates switching cost - harder to leave**

---

## Analysis Process

**Step 1: Current Behavior Loop**
- What's current trigger?
- What's the action?
- What's the reward?
- What's the investment?

**Step 2: Optimize Each Stage**
- Trigger: More frequent? More relevant?
- Action: Easier? Clearer?
- Reward: More meaningful? Variable?
- Investment: Deeper commitment?

**Step 3: Measure Success**
- DAU (Daily Active Users)
- Retention day 1, 7, 30
- Habit formation timeline

## Deliverable: engagement-strategy.md

**Include sections:**

1. **Hook Model Diagram** (For main use case)
   - Trigger: [What prompts action?]
   - Action: [What does user do?]
   - Reward: [What's payoff?] (Self/Tribe/Hunt)
   - Investment: [What commits user?]

2. **Engagement Mechanics**
   - How frequent is trigger? (Daily? Weekly?)
   - How easy is action? (1-click? 5-steps?)
   - How meaningful is reward?
   - How deep is investment?

3. **Retention Drivers**
   - What makes users come back?
   - What causes drop-off?
   - When do habits form?

4. **Friction Points**
   - Where do users abandon?
   - What's preventing loop completion?
   - How to reduce friction?

5. **Engagement Metrics**
   - DAU (target: [X]% of users)
   - Retention: Day 1 [X]%, Day 7 [X]%, Day 30 [X]%
   - Habit loop completion: [X]% of users
   - Time to habit formation: [X] days

6. **Variant Hooks** (If multiple use cases)
   - Hook for power users
   - Hook for casual users
   - Hook for returning users

7. **Decision Gate**
   - Question: "Are habit loops designed to drive adoption?"
   - Answer: YES → Proceed to Phase 7 | NO → Refine

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Hook model complete (all 4 stages)
- [ ] Trigger is reliable and frequent
- [ ] Action is easy (low friction)
- [ ] Reward is meaningful
- [ ] Investment deepens engagement
- [ ] Retention metrics defined
- [ ] Friction points identified

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If decision gate is NO:**

- Hook model incomplete (missing stage)
- Trigger is weak (users forget)
- Action is too hard (too many steps)
- Reward not meaningful (users don't care)
- No investment (easy to leave)

**What to do:**
1. Identify which stage is weakest
2. Redesign that stage
3. Re-test with users
4. Proceed when complete
