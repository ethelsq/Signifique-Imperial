# Phase 1: Mental Models Mapping

**Agent:** @indy-young
**Duration:** 1 week (40 hours)
**Deliverable:** mental-models.md + diagram

---

## Purpose

Map how users actually think about your domain. Not what they SAY they want, but what they're DOING and WHY. Mental models drive all downstream design decisions.

---

## What You'll Do

1. **Define task-based segments** - NOT demographics
2. **Recruit 10-12 users** - Actual users performing the task
3. **Conduct interviews** - Non-leading, behavior-focused
4. **Analyze transcripts** - Extract actual tasks
5. **Build affinity diagram** - Group tasks into patterns
6. **Validate with domain experts**
7. **Create visual mental model**

---

## Inputs Required

**From Phase 0:**
- [ ] Brand vision document
- [ ] Brand positioning

**From You:**
- [ ] User types to interview (3-5 segments)
- [ ] How to reach them (recruitment path)
- [ ] Current product/service (if exists)
- [ ] Problem domain description

---

## Elicitation: Recruitment

**[ELICIT]** Define your interview participants:

```
Task/Problem you're researching:
[____________]

Who should we interview? (Not demographics - actual user types):
1. [____________]
2. [____________]
3. [____________]

How do we reach them?
[____________]

How many users? (Recommend: 10-12 total)
[____________]
```

---

## Interview Method

**CRITICAL: Do NOT lead users**

Good questions:
- "Tell me about the last time you [did X]"
- "Walk me through what happens when you..."
- "What gets in the way?"
- "How do you decide between [alternatives]?"

Bad questions:
- "Would you like feature X?" (leads to yes)
- "Don't you want [our positioning]?" (leading)
- "What features do you want?" (feature, not task)

**Interviews:** 45-60 min each, 10-12 users

---

## Analysis Process

**Step 1: Extract Tasks**
- Read transcript
- Find every task: "I'm trying to..."
- NOT features: ignore "I want button X"
- Extract: task + motivation + barrier

**Step 2: Group into Patterns**
- Spreadsheet: task name, user type, motivation
- Look for clusters: "Do 5+ users have this task?"
- These are PATTERNS

**Step 3: Create Affinity Diagram**
- Vertical axis: tasks (biggest to smallest)
- Horizontal axis: sequence or category
- Blocks show: task + motivation + emotional state

**Step 4: Validate**
- Show diagram to domain experts
- "Does this match how your domain works?"
- Refine if needed

## Deliverable: mental-models.md

**Include sections:**

1. **Research Summary**
   - How many users interviewed?
   - Which segments?
   - Interview duration?

2. **Task-Based Segments** (NOT demographic!)
   - Segment 1: "People trying to..."
   - Segment 2: "People trying to..."
   - Why these segments matter

3. **Mental Model Diagram** (Visual)
   - Description of diagram structure
   - Explanation of each row (task cluster)
   - What patterns emerged?

4. **Key Tasks Identified** (Top 10-15)
   - Task name
   - % of users doing it
   - Primary motivation
   - Barriers encountered

5. **User Journey by Segment**
   - How each segment approaches problem differently
   - Shared vs. divergent tasks

6. **Design/Product Recommendations**
   - What did model reveal about product/service?
   - Opportunities identified?
   - Gaps between current and needed?

7. **Decision Gate**
   - Question: "Do we understand user mental models and key tasks?"
   - Answer: YES → Proceed to Phase 2 | NO → More interviews

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 10-12 users interviewed (min 8)
- [ ] Mental model is VISUAL (not just text)
- [ ] Tasks extracted from behavior (not stated preferences)
- [ ] Segments are task-based (not demographic)
- [ ] 3-5 dominant patterns/segments identified
- [ ] Domain experts validate diagram
- [ ] Design recommendations flow from model

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If decision gate is NO:**

- Only 5-6 users interviewed (too small sample)
- Mental model is too vague/generic
- Segments are demographic ("millennials") not task-based
- Tasks are features ("wants better UI") not actual jobs
- Model doesn't match domain expert reality

**What to do:**
1. Interview 4-6 MORE users (different types)
2. Go back to transcripts, look for TASKS not features
3. Regroup tasks into clearer patterns
4. Validate again with 2-3 domain experts
5. Run decision gate again

## Next Phase: Phase 2 - Market Structure

**Input:** Mental models diagram + task-based segments
**Agent:** @michael-porter
**Duration:** 1 week
**Purpose:** Analyze market structure using Five Forces
