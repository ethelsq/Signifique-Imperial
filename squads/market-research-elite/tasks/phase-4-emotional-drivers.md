# Phase 4: Emotional Drivers & Unconscious Motivations

**Agent:** @gerald-zaltman
**Duration:** 1.5 weeks (12 hours research + interview time)
**Deliverable:** emotional-drivers.md

---

## Purpose

Uncover HIDDEN emotional motivations and unconscious drivers. What customers SAY they want ≠ what they actually want. Metaphors reveal truth.

---

## What You'll Do

1. **Interview 8-10 customers** - Using ZMET method
2. **Collect metaphorical images** - Visual representations
3. **Analyze metaphors** - What do they reveal?
4. **Map unconscious drivers** - Desires, fears, identities
5. **Identify emotional barriers** - What prevents adoption?
6. **Validate against stated jobs** - Align or conflict?

---

## Inputs Required

**From Phase 3:**
- [ ] Job statements (functional + emotional + social)
- [ ] Competitive alternatives
- [ ] Customer understanding

**From You:**
- [ ] 8-10 customers for interviews
- [ ] Willingness to dig deeper than surveys

---

## Elicitation: Metaphor Research

**[ELICIT]** What metaphors represent your brand/problem?

```
If your brand was a metaphor, what would it be?
Examples: "trusted advisor", "sanctuary", "warrior"
[____________]

What metaphors do customers use naturally?
(Listen to how they describe needing/using your product)
[____________]

What emotions come up when discussing this problem?
[____________]
```

## ZMET Research Method

### The Interview (45-60 min)

**Part 1: Visual Exploration**
- "Find 5-8 images that represent [brand/problem]"
- Can be from magazines, internet, own photos
- Don't explain yet

**Part 2: Image Walk-Through**
- One image at a time
- "Tell me about this image"
- "Why did you choose it?"
- Listen for metaphors, not literal descriptions

**Part 3: Metaphor Deepening**
- "What metaphor comes to mind?"
- "Is there a character/story in the image?"
- "What's the emotional connection?"

**Part 4: Model Building**
- "If all these images were combined, what would they create?"
- "What's the overall metaphor?"
- "What's missing?"

### What to Listen For (NOT What They Say)

- **Unconscious drivers** (deeper than stated reason)
- **Metaphors** (how they naturally describe)
- **Emotions** (fear, desire, shame, pride)
- **Identity** (how they see themselves)
- **Barriers** (hidden objections)

---

## Analysis Process

**Step 1: Collect images from 8-10 users**

**Step 2: Analyze patterns**
- What metaphors repeat?
- What emotions cluster?
- What fears emerge?

**Step 3: Build metaphor map**
- Central metaphor?
- Sub-metaphors?
- Emotional territory?

**Step 4: Identify barriers**
- What's preventing adoption?
- Emotional resistance?
- Identity misalignment?

**Include sections:**

1. **Research Summary**
   - How many users interviewed?
   - Metaphor collection method?
   - Any patterns?

2. **Primary Metaphors Identified** (Top 3-5)
   - Metaphor 1: [What is it?]
     - What does it reveal about emotions?
     - How widespread is it?
   - Metaphor 2: ...

3. **Unconscious Motivations**
   - What do customers really want? (Beyond stated job)
   - What fears exist?
   - What aspirations?
   - What identity do they want?

4. **Emotional Barriers**
   - What's preventing adoption?
   - Emotional resistance?
   - Identity misalignment?
   - Shame/fear factors?

5. **Comparison to Stated Jobs**
   - How do emotions compare to Phase 3 jobs?
   - Alignment or conflict?
   - Implications?

6. **Positioning Implications**
   - Based on emotional drivers, how should we position?
   - Emotional benefits vs. functional?
   - Messaging angles?

7. **Decision Gate**
   - Question: "Do emotional insights align with stated jobs?"
   - Answer: YES → Proceed to Phase 5 | CONFLICT → Reconcile

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 8-10 users interviewed with metaphor method
- [ ] Metaphors consistent across participants
- [ ] Hidden motivations revealed (vs. stated reasons)
- [ ] Emotional barriers identified
- [ ] Emotional positioning options clear
- [ ] Emotions compared against functional jobs

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If decision gate is CONFLICT:**

- "Customers say they want X (function) but feel Y (emotion)" = Opportunity!
- Example: Say they want efficiency, but feel they want mastery/control
- This reveals real positioning angle

**Resolution:**
1. Investigate the conflict
2. Refine jobs analysis (maybe job is incomplete)
3. Use emotional insight to position differently
4. Proceed when aligned

## Next Phase: Phase 5 - Assumption Testing

**Input:** Emotional drivers + job alignment
**Agent:** @rita-mcgrath
**Duration:** 5 weeks
**Purpose:** Rank and test risky assumptions
