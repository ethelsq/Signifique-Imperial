# Phase 7: Behavior Change Execution Design

**Agent:** @bj-fogg
**Duration:** 1 week (8 hours)
**Deliverable:** execution-design.md

---

## Purpose

Design EXECUTION that removes friction to desired behavior. B=MAP: Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. All three must exist.

---

## What You'll Do

1. **Define desired behavior precisely** - Specific action
2. **Assess current M, A, P** - Motivation, Ability, Prompt
3. **Identify limiting constraint** - Which one stops people?
4. **Design friction reduction** - Target the constraint
5. **Plan execution roadmap** - How to implement

---

## Inputs Required

**From Phase 6:**
- [ ] Engagement strategy
- [ ] Hook models
- [ ] Friction points

**From You:**
- [ ] Current user behavior data
- [ ] Barriers you observe
- [ ] Execution resources available

---

## B=MAP Framework

### MOTIVATION

**Three Types:**

1. **Seek Pleasure / Avoid Pain** (Hedonic)
   - Feel good vs. avoid discomfort
   - Immediate, emotional

2. **Seek Hope / Avoid Fear** (Anticipatory)
   - Future possibility vs. anxiety
   - Medium-term

3. **Seek Acceptance / Avoid Rejection** (Social)
   - Belonging vs. isolation
   - Social pressure/support

**Reality:** Most people have MEDIUM motivation
- Don't rely on motivation (it changes)
- Design for low motivation scenarios

### ABILITY

**Six Factors (Reduce ANY to make behavior easier):**

1. **Time** - Reduce time commitment
2. **Effort** - Reduce steps/complexity
3. **Money** - Make cheaper
4. **Brain Cycles** - Reduce thinking required
5. **Physical Effort** - Make physically easier
6. **Social Deviance** - Make less socially awkward

**Reality:** Easiest path = improve ability
- Even small ability improvements big impact
- Motivation is harder to change

### PROMPT

**When behavior is triggered:**

- **At moment of high motivation** (ideal)
- **Anchored to existing routine** (reliable)
- **High emotional state** (memorable)
- **Repeated exposure** (habitual)

**Reality:** Prompt must be RELIABLE
- Users forget without reminder
- Anchor to existing behavior = automatic

---

## Analysis Process

**Step 1: Define Behavior**
- Specific action (not vague goal)
- Example: NOT "Exercise more" BUT "Walk 15 min after breakfast"
- Measurable, observable

**Step 2: Assess M, A, P**
- Motivation: 1-10 scale (how much do they want it?)
- Ability: 1-10 scale (how easy is it?)
- Prompt: Exists? Reliable?

**Step 3: Identify Constraint**
- Which is LOWEST?
- That's your limiting factor
- Focus there first

**Step 4: Design Intervention**
- If Motivation low: Will motivation approach work? (Unlikely - address ability instead)
- If Ability low: Reduce friction (time, effort, steps, thinking)
- If Prompt weak: Create reliable trigger, anchor to routine

## Deliverable: execution-design.md

**Include sections:**

1. **Desired Behavior** (Specific and Measurable)
   - What exact action?
   - When/where?
   - How often?

2. **B=MAP Analysis**
   - **Motivation:** 1-10 (Current state)
     - Type: Pleasure? Hope? Acceptance?
     - Challenge: How to sustain?
   - **Ability:** 1-10 (Current state)
     - Hardest part?
     - Time/effort/steps/thinking/physical/social?
   - **Prompt:** Exists? Reliable?
     - Current trigger?
     - Frequency?
     - Reliability?

3. **Limiting Constraint**
   - Which one stops people?
   - Why?
   - What's impact?

4. **Friction Reduction Strategy** (Address constraint)
   - If Ability limiting: [Reduce this friction]
   - If Prompt limiting: [Create this trigger]
   - If Motivation: [Only if absolutely necessary]

5. **Execution Design**
   - Step 1: [Implementation]
   - Step 2: [Implementation]
   - Step 3: [Implementation]

6. **Tiny Habits Approach** (Start small)
   - Make behavior absurdly small
   - Anchor to existing routine
   - Celebrate immediately
   - Iterate and expand

7. **Measurement Framework**
   - How to track behavior?
   - Success metric: [Specific, measurable]
   - Timeline: By [date]

8. **Decision Gate**
   - Question: "Can we reduce friction to desired behavior?"
   - Answer: YES → READY FOR LAUNCH | NO → Re-examine model

---

## Example: Exercise Behavior

**Desired Behavior:** Walk 15 min after breakfast

**B=MAP:**
- Motivation: 6/10 (Want to but busy)
- Ability: 7/10 (Know how, have time)
- Prompt: 2/10 (No reliable trigger)

**Limiting Constraint:** Prompt (no trigger)

**Friction Reduction:**
- Anchor to breakfast (existing routine)
- Prepare walking clothes night before
- Share goal with accountability partner
- Celebrate with coffee after walk

**Result:** Walking becomes automatic (attached to breakfast)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Behavior is specific and measurable
- [ ] All three (M, A, P) assessed
- [ ] Limiting constraint identified
- [ ] Friction reduction targets main constraint
- [ ] Actual behavior changes (not attitudes)
- [ ] Tiny habits approach included
- [ ] Measurement framework defined

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If gate is NO:**

- Behavior still has too much friction
- Problem wasn't B=MAP (check earlier phases)
- Constraint misidentified
- Intervention too ambitious (not tiny enough)

**What to do:**
1. Return to B=MAP analysis
2. Identify real constraint
3. Design smaller intervention
4. Test with real users
5. Iterate

## Next Phase: DELIVERY & LAUNCH

**Input:** Execution design
**Handoff to:** marketing-opes squad
**Timeline:** 30 days
**Purpose:** Implement and measure behavior change

---

## 🎯 You're DONE with research phase!

**What happens now:**

1. **Integrate findings** - Synthesize all 8 phases
2. **Create master report** - Executive summary + 30 recommendations
3. **Decision point** - GO / NO-GO / CONDITIONAL
4. **Pass to operations** - marketing-opes takes it from here
