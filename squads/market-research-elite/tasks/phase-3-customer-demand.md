# Phase 3: Customer Demand Analysis

**Agent:** @clayton-christensen
**Duration:** 1 week (8 hours)
**Deliverable:** customer-demand.md

---

## Purpose

Identify the JOBS customers are trying to accomplish. Not features they want, not demographic segments - the PROGRESS they're trying to make. This drives everything.

---

## What You'll Do

1. **Analyze mental models** - What tasks emerged from Phase 1?
2. **Interview customers** - "What job are you hiring us/competitors for?"
3. **Map three job types** - Functional + Emotional + Social
4. **Identify circumstance** - When/why does job matter?
5. **Map competitive alternatives** - What else solves this job?
6. **Identify switching triggers** - When would they switch?

---

## Inputs Required

**From Phase 1 & 2:**
- [ ] Mental models diagrams
- [ ] Task-based segments
- [ ] Market structure analysis

**From You:**
- [ ] Current customers (for interviews)
- [ ] Competitor research
- [ ] Switching history (who left? why?)

---

## Elicitation: Job Discovery

**[ELICIT]** Define 3-5 potential jobs customers need done:

```
Job 1: "What progress are customers trying to make?"
[____________]

Job 2:
[____________]

Job 3:
[____________]

For each job: What are functional/emotional/social components?
[____________]
```

---

## Jobs Framework

### Job = Progress Customer Wants to Make

**Three Dimensions:**

1. **Functional Job**
   - Task to accomplish
   - Objective outcome
   - What problem solving?

2. **Emotional Job**
   - How should customer feel?
   - Emotional outcome
   - What perception/identity?

3. **Social Job**
   - How wants to be seen by others?
   - Social status/identity
   - What impression to make?

**Example: Coffee Purchase**
- Functional: Caffeine/energy during commute
- Emotional: Feel alert, energized, in control
- Social: Be professional/competent (not tired at work)

---

## Analysis Process

**Step 1: Interview 5-8 customers**
- "Tell me about last time you bought [product/service]"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- "What else did you consider?"
- "Why choose us over alternatives?"
- "When would you switch to competitor?"

**Step 2: Extract jobs**
- What's the PROGRESS they wanted?
- Functional component?
- Emotional component?
- Social component?

**Step 3: Map alternatives**
- What else solves this job? (NOT just competitors)
- Coffee, energy drink, nap, podcast?
- Each alternative solves different dimension

**Step 4: Identify switching triggers**
- What causes them to switch?
- When does job change?
- What competitor could win them?

## Deliverable: customer-demand.md

**Include sections:**

1. **Circumstance** (Context matters!)
   - When/where does job emerge?
   - What triggers need?
   - Who has this need?

2. **Job Statements** (3-5 jobs, 3 dimensions each)
   - Job 1: [Name]
     - Functional: [What task?]
     - Emotional: [How feel?]
     - Social: [How seen?]
   - Job 2: ...

3. **Competitive Alternatives**
   - For each job, what else could customer "hire"?
   - Why might they choose alternative?
   - What's advantage of alternative?

4. **Switching Triggers**
   - What causes switching?
   - What competitor could win them?
   - How frequent do jobs change?

5. **Validation Against Mental Models**
   - Do jobs align with Phase 1 tasks?
   - Where diverge?
   - Why?

6. **Segment Implications**
   - Do different segments have different jobs?
   - Different functional/emotional/social emphasis?
   - Positioning implications?

7. **Decision Gate**
   - Question: "Do we have clear job clarity aligned with mental models?"
   - Answer: YES → Proceed to Phase 4 | NO → Back to interviews

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Emotional job clearly identified (not just functional)
- [ ] Circumstance understood (when/why job emerges)
- [ ] Competitive alternatives mapped (not just competitors)
- [ ] Switching triggers defined (when would they leave?)
- [ ] Jobs align with Phase 1 mental models
- [ ] All three job dimensions present per job

---

## When This Phase Fails

**If decision gate is NO:**

- Only functional job identified (emotional/social missing)
- Circumstance not understood (just "everyone has this need")
- Competitive alternatives only include direct competitors
- Jobs don't match Phase 1 mental models

**What to do:**
1. More interviews (focus on emotional/social)
2. Ask: "When does this job REALLY matter?"
3. Expand competitive alternatives beyond direct competitors
4. Reconcile with mental models (are mental models wrong or job analysis incomplete?)

## Next Phase: Phase 4 - Emotional Drivers

**Input:** Job statements + competitive alternatives
**Agent:** @gerald-zaltman
**Duration:** 1.5 weeks
**Purpose:** Uncover hidden emotional motivations
