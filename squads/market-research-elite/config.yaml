  description: |
    Elite squad of market research specialists using 6 complementary frameworks:
    Porter (structure), Christensen (demand), Zaltman (emotion), McGrath (testing),
    Eyal (engagement), Fogg (behavior). Sequential research pipeline for deep insights.

  domain: Market Research & Consumer Insights
  keywords:
    - market-analysis
    - competitive-structure
    - customer-demand
    - hidden-motivations
    - assumption-testing
    - engagement-design
    - behavior-change

  purpose: |
    Conduct comprehensive market research using 6 elite frameworks in sequence.
    From structural analysis → demand identification → emotional discovery →
    assumption validation → engagement design → behavior change execution.

  target_users:
    - Product managers entering new markets
    - Startup founders evaluating market viability
    - Marketing strategists optimizing customer adoption
    - Product designers improving user behavior
    - Business development teams planning market entry

  ideal_use_cases:
    - Market entry decisions (is market viable + how?)
    - Product adoption barriers (why aren't customers using it?)
    - Competitive positioning (how do we differentiate?)
    - Behavior change programs (how to drive user adoption?)
    - Customer research (what's really driving demand?)

execution:
  primary_workflow: market_entry_research

  sequence: sequential
  # Agents work in order - each informs the next
  # Phase N insights feed into Phase N+1 questions

  parallelization: "within-phase"
  # Within McGrath's testing phase, multiple tests can run in parallel
  # But Porter → Christensen → Zaltman must be sequential

  decision_gates:

      question: "Is this market structurally viable?"
      pass: "Proceed to demand analysis"
      fail: "Reconsider market choice or reframe positioning"

    after_christensen:
      question: "Do we have clear job clarity?"
      pass: "Proceed to emotional research"
      fail: "Return to Porter/Christensen for better clarity"

    after_zaltman:
      question: "Do emotional insights align with stated jobs?"
      pass: "Proceed to assumption testing"
      fail: "Reconcile contradiction before proceeding"

    after_mcgrath:
      question: "Have riskiest assumptions been tested and validated?"
      pass: "Proceed to engagement design"
