    Elite squad of market research specialists using 8 complementary frameworks:
    Aaker (brand strategy), Young (mental models), Porter (structure), Christensen (demand),
    Zaltman (emotion), McGrath (testing), Eyal (engagement), Fogg (behavior).
    Sequential research pipeline from brand clarity → market understanding → behavior change.

  purpose: |
    Conduct comprehensive market research using 8 elite frameworks in sequence.
    From brand strategy clarity → user mental models → market structure analysis →
    demand identification → emotional discovery → assumption validation →
    engagement design → behavior change execution.

  target_users:
    - Product managers entering new markets
    - Startup founders evaluating market viability
    - Marketing strategists optimizing customer adoption
    - Product designers improving user behavior
    - Business development teams planning market entry

  ideal_use_cases:
    - Market entry decisions (is market viable + how?)
    - Product adoption barriers (why aren't customers using it?)
    - Competitive positioning (how do we differentiate?)
    - Behavior change programs (how to drive user adoption?)
    - Customer research (what's really driving demand?)

execution:

  sequence: sequential
  # Agents work in order - each informs the next
  # Phase N insights feed into Phase N+1 questions

  parallelization: "within-phase"
  # Within McGrath's testing phase, multiple tests can run in parallel
  # But Porter → Christensen → Zaltman must be sequential
